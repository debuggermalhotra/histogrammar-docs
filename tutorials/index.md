## Utilities

Other pages refer back to these for set-up that would otherwise have to be repeated.

  * [Installation](../install): The first step.
  * [CMS public dataset in Scala](scala-cmsdata): Sample data for plots.
  * [CMS public dataset in Python](python-cmsdata): The same sample data, accessed in Python.

## Basic tutorials

  * [Aggregating data in Scala](scala-basic): Histogrammar without any custom backends (for gathering data from unusual places) or frontends (for plotting it). Focuses on the basics of aggregation, what makes Histogrammar different, and ASCII-art plots.
